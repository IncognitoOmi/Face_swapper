# Face Swap with Juggernaut Model

This repository provides an implementation of face-swapping using the **Juggernaut Model**. The notebook demonstrates how to swap faces in images or videos efficiently using pre-trained models.

---

## **Features**
- Perform face swapping between two images or video frames.
- Utilizes the **Juggernaut Model** for accurate facial recognition and transformation.
- Handles complex scenarios like:
  - Different facial angles.
  - Variations in lighting and expression.

---

## **Workflow**
1. **Face Detection**:
   - Detects faces in the input image or video using a pre-trained model.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracts facial landmarks to understand facial structure.
3. **Face Swap**:
   - Reconstructs and maps the facial features onto the target image or video.
4. **Post-Processing**:
   - Adjusts for blending and smoothing for natural-looking results.
